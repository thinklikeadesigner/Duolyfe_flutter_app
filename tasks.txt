app initializes wrapper, so wrapper is the first screen

appview is the new wrapper
in appview: user data can be null, or it can exist
if user is null, user is not logged in and user is directed to the sign in screen

need to add a state and event to check for completed onboarding
NOTES decide what the default data for user should be.


the first check checks if the user has data.
if the user has data, it means they have at least been to the 2nd page of onboarding
(doesnt matter, bc you dont need default data you can save as you go) user has data means A user completed onboarding or B user has started but did not finish onboarding


if the user exists, onboarding can be null, false, or true

to summarize, user states in wrapper are:
A) user is not logged in
B) user logged in &&
    a)user doesnt have data
    b)user has data &&
        I) user did not finish onboarding
        II) user finished onboarding


The actions are
A) redirect to sign in
a) send to onboarding
I) send to onboarding
II) send to home screen

signin screen:

3 states
 - user not logged in
 - user logged in
 - user begins automated google authentication flow

onboarding screen: stateless
2 user actions, skip and let's go
skip goes to milonamepicked and skips choosing and naming the buddy
go goes to choosebuddy

choosebuddy screen: currently stateful

- user doesnt have data
    - loading
- user has data
    - _currentbuddy == null
    - _currentbuddy != null
    - buddy is saved
    - buddy is not saved
        - data is sent
        - data error
- currentbuddy image is set as an argument to choosename screen
    

choosename screen: currently stateless
- skip goes to milonamepicked
- milo goes to milonamepicked
- sky goes to skynamepicked
- arguement for image is passed to next screen as an argument


milo/skynamepicked screen: stateless
- arguement for image is passed to next screen as an argument
- only one button, 'save buddy' and goes to chooseactivity

chooseactivity screen: currently stateful
there's a lot going on here
there's no button, unless at least 3 activities are choosename
possible states:
- button disabled
- button enabled
    - data sent to server
    - data failed
        - show loading?
- 0, 1, or 2 activities picked
- 3 or more activities picked
image arguments passed to next page

picktime screen: idk??? i really want to ignore this screen in favor of the core features
anyways
possible states: 
    - time picked
    - no time picked
    - save button pressed
        - data sent
            - complete dialogue pops up
                - 'approve' button navigates to home
        - data not sent
            - loading?

home screen: stateful
possible events
- health going up
- health going down
- give milo treat
- show activities
- chooseactivity
    - task added to list
        - data sent
        - data failed
            - show loading?
- change buddy

bottomnavbar:
- just switches between screens

task screen
possible events
- task added to list
- task completed
    - task filled in and disabled
    - points data sent
        - data sent
        - data failed

    - should uncompleted tasks be deleteable?
    - should you be able to add multiple uncompleted tasks?


- decide which data should be persisted locally versus cached in the cloud


NEED need a better way to check if onboarding is completed, bc the value can be null in between sign in and the first onboarding screen
IDEA i think i need a user store for local data and not auth
NOTES need to make the name a data object to persist along with the buddy image and save both in database
REFACTOR make stateful widgets stateless
CREATED activity bloc
CREATED buddy bloc
MAKEME name bloc
