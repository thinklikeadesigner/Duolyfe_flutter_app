During the pandemic, a lot of workers shifted from their offices to their homes. The lines between professional and domestic life became blurred. This led to people working longer hours, and inevitably, burnout. 

To combat this, we propose the solution of having an accountability partner in the form of a cute animal buddy! This buddy will suggest healthy or relaxing activities to get users away from their screens. It will also remind users to feed it, and snacks come in the form of tasks you complete!

It's like tamagotchi, but for well-being :)
